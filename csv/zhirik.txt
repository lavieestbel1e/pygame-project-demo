                              Vladimir Zhirinovsky


Brief biography:
Zhirinovsky was born in Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh SSR. In July 1964, Zhirinovsky 
moved from Almaty to Moscow, where he began his studies in the Department of Turkish Studies,
Institute of Asian and African Countries at Moscow State University (MSU), from which he 
graduated in 1969. Although he participated in some reformist groups, Zhirinovsky was little 
known in Soviet political developments during the 1980s. In April 1991, Zhirinovsky, along with 
Vladimir Bogachev, took initiatives which led to the founding of the Liberal Democratic 
Party of the Soviet Union, the second registered party in the Soviet Union in 1990, and 
therefore the first officially sanctioned opposition party. He was participating in Russsian
president elections 6 times. His highest result was in 2012 (12%). After war broke out between 
Russia and Georgia in 2008, Zhirinovsky argued in favour of Russian recognition of Abkhazian 
and South Ossetian independence. In a speech on 27 December 2021, Zhirinovsky appeared to 
almost predict the day of the well-known armed conflict in eastern Europe. In February 2022, 
Zhirinovsky was hospitalized in critical condition in Moscow with COVID-19. Unfortunatley,
he died on 6 April 2022. He was 75.

How was he different?
He was a future predictor. With the help of his poltical, socail and diplomacy knowledge he
was able to analyze the situation in a definit region and draw conclusions about it.
